bloomberg vs reuters: (monitor and analyze financial information softwares)

	Integration Ease:
		Reuters Eikon is easier to integrate with Tableau. It has a simpler setup process.
	Data Coverage:
		Bloomberg provides a wider range of financial data, not just exchange rates. It's more 	comprehensive for financial professionals.
	
	Cost:
		Costs for data access from Bloomberg and Reuters can differ greatly. Budget considerations 	are crucial when deciding between the two. 

		Bloomberg is expensive : - The standard Bloomberg Terminal costs around 2000$ per month, or 24000$ per year -> to access currency exchange data
								 - 400$/month for access to the website and app + live radios + newsletter + tv streaming


		the Reuters Data API starts at $1,500 per month for a basic plan with 100,000 API calls.

		they're expensive because they are used for stocks and have stocks informations, accounting, and a lot more than just currency, so they're both an overkill, unless we are interested in stocks, rates and bonds, commodities and a lot more financial data for inversters sake on stocks. its better to use apis that are only for the purpose we need to lower the costs.

		To get a deal on both you need to contact sales.


Redifinitiv 
	for this too to get prices, contacting sales is required, but through researching, some says $500 per month for business plans, and there's an information about it costing around +12000$ a year for a terminal to access its data (like bloomberg)


Globally, to get a more precise information about pricing, contacting sales is required.

For Connecting:
	we apparently can connect any rest API through something we can code using tableau called "Web Data Connectors", that we can host on the server running tableau from and it'll be used to fetch data, we can also Schedule Refresh for data refreshing.


tableau WDC is probably deprecated?
