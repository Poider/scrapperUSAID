	farmer analytics
	he put on tableau, 
}
	Question : -how many tables
			   -which sql db exactly you know?

			   -is this data fix or still on update?
			   	//How will we handle data updates on source if there should be any?

			   -how did you connect apis elsewise?

			   -do you have a data schema, like relations between data for when I wanna migrate this data
			   /// Are there any documentation or metadata about the source data?
				is there relations?

			   -Are there any data transformations or cleaning processes required before migration?

			   -since I'll try migrating this database, do we have a server with a database ourselves 

			   - did you connect an api to tableau or straight just the sql db
			   
			   -which data I take
