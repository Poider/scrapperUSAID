	ZIAD MEETING > agronomie IT worked on tableau:

					they cleaned the indicators, they disucussed faostat and ifastat stuff
					we neglect the sql for now. since its for the ones they worked with, and our db will be for the general stuff from external

	CHECK DATA WE USING THIS FOR
	interactive carte meeting:
		questions 14:30: 

			- sql we can make an api on top of it later to collect data straight from it especially if its on the same network (hosted in the same server)




			- we need source file or do we need to integrate their map straight to our web app

			- do we have a server to host the database and the webapplication and do we have access to it yet?
			
			- I do not know exactly how you guys communite/ use open street map, but there's a database behind this or does it use files 
			
			<!-- - is our app -->
