    "description": "Creating jobs, running demonstrations for farmers and agripreneurs, increasing yields, and installing field schools, the OCP Agribooster is our flagship programme that continues to make tangible transformations and connections across Africa. \nThe Agribooster program aims at holistically supporting the farmers across all the pain points they are facing, by securing their access to high quality inputs, training on good agronomic practices, and securing of market linkages upstream of their agricultural campaign. The ecosystem developed de-risks the farmers’ investments and facilitates their access to finance. \nA demand creation programme, Agribooster aims to improve farmers’ yields and income through a value chain approach. Its objective is to link the famers to markets through closed-loop partnerships. ",

In addition, the center will provide local agronomic services and advice, enabling farmers to benefit from personalized support to improve their farming practices. A key component of the center will be the production of fertilizers tailored to the specific needs of soils and crops, thanks to the provision of a Smart Blender, which will enable farmers to obtain customized fertilizer blends to optimize crop and soil nutrition and improve yields.\nThe Agricultural Service Center will be equipped with a modern soil analysis laboratory, enabling soil fertility maps to be drawn up and updated. In addition, the laboratory will ensure quality control of fertilizers by measuring the content of nutrients (N, P and K) and additives (Zn, B, Mn, S...). It will also provide soil analysis and quality control services for other regions and partners.\nAgricultural mechanization and irrigation systems will also play a key role in the center. Farm machinery and irrigation equipment will be made available to farmers, along with a mechanical workshop for preventive and curative maintenance.\nIn addition to these key services, the center will include a Call Center offering ongoing support to farmers, a model farm to demonstrate good agronomic practices, and a network of agricultural advisors to support and empower farmers.
