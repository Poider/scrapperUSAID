  "description": "OCP School Lab is a program constituted by a mobile laboratory and field school leveraging on physical training and content as well as digital tools. Thanks to a team of agricultural engineers, farmers benefit from multiyear support and technological solutions to stay connected or in direct contact with agricultural advisors. This school offers demonstrations and educational training sessions for raising awareness about agricultural practices in accordance with the predominant culture of the regions in which they are located. Each training is adapted to the dominant cultures in the areas visited. A mobile laboratory asso- ciated with the schools systematically analyzes the soil in the targeted regions.

  "description": "OCP Africa established the Farmer Hubs in 2019, as a “one-stop shop” that provides farmers with access to inputs (fertilizers, seeds and phytosan- itary products), and agricultural services (training on good agronomic practices, soil analysis and recommendation, financial services, market connections, mechanization etc.).\nThe Farmer Hubs concept adapts to the context of each country where we can deploy the Farmer Houses in partnership with governments (federal, regional and local authorities) or private actors, young entrepreneurs or cooperatives. OCP Africa has developed several complementary packages at these Farmer Hubs that can be deployed to respond to each farmer’s needs and context. These packages are disseminated with the stra- tegic deployment of agripromoters to ensure that farmers are taking the steps required for optimum harvests. The agripromoters (equipped with tricy- cles and tablets) are also central to the provision of soil-testing, mapping services, training, and digital solutions to farmers.\r",

OCP Africa has developed several complementary packages at these Farmer Hubs that can be deployed to respond to each farmer’s needs and context. These packages are disseminated with the stra- tegic deployment of agripromoters to ensure that farmers are taking the steps required for optimum harvests. The agripromoters (equipped with tricy- cles and tablets) are also central to the provision of soil-testing, mapping services, training, and digital solutions to farmers.\r",

In addition, the center will provide local agronomic services and advice, enabling farmers to benefit from personalized support to improve their farming practices. A key component of the center will be the production of fertilizers tailored to the specific needs of soils and crops, thanks to the provision of a Smart Blender, which will enable farmers to obtain customized fertilizer blends to optimize crop and soil nutrition and improve yields.\nThe Agricultural Service Center will be equipped with a modern soil analysis laboratory, enabling soil fertility maps to be drawn up and updated. In addition, the laboratory will ensure quality control of fertilizers by measuring the content of nutrients (N, P and K) and additives (Zn, B, Mn, S...). It will also provide soil analysis and quality control services for other regions and partners.\nAgricultural mechanization and irrigation systems will also play a key role in the center. Farm machinery and irrigation equipment will be made available to farmers, along with a mechanical workshop for preventive and curative maintenance.\nIn addition to these key services, the center will include a Call Center offering ongoing support to farmers, a model farm to demonstrate good agronomic practices, and a network of agricultural advisors to support and empower farmers.

These inoculants will exhibit improved shelf life, high stability, persistence, and viability of microorganisms living under field soil conditions. The primary objective is to effectively increase legume yields and atmospheric nitrogen fixation for enhanced farmers' incomes in Nigeria and Ghana. \n\nTo achieve this goal, extensive screening of soybean varieties has been conducted to evaluate nodulation, growth, and Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) under both greenhouse\n and field conditions. The evaluation encompasses the varietal response of soybeans to inoculation and substrate preferences across different soil types in Ghana and Nigeria. \n\nIn 2023, the project will expand its scope to encompass nine new countries: Kenya, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Benin, Tanzania, Zambia, Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Rwanda. This expansion aims to promote sustainable agricultural practices and improve crop productivity in these countries. ",

  "description": "For a sustainable agriculture, OCP Africa in collaboration with research and development partners Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, Bayero University (Nigeria), and the Savanna Agriculture Research Institute (Ghana), aims to develop industrially scalable methods for producing rhizobia inoculants. These inoculants will exhibit improved shelf life, high stability, persistence, and viability of microorganisms living under field soil conditions. The primary objective is to effectively increase legume yields and atmospheric nitrogen fixation for enhanced farmers' incomes in Nigeria and Ghana. \n\nTo achieve this goal, extensive screening of soybean varieties has been conducted to evaluate nodulation, growth, and Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) under both greenhouse\n and field conditions. The evaluation encompasses the varietal response of soybeans to inoculation and substrate preferences across different soil types in Ghana and Nigeria. \n\nIn 2023, the project will expand its scope to encompass nine new countries: Kenya, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Benin, Tanzania, Zambia, Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Rwanda. This expansion aims to promote sustainable agricultural practices and improve crop productivity in these countries. ",
