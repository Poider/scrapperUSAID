Can have both ways, since graphs will exists its just about dashboard grouping which graphs/ sheets

**Mayssoun's ideas**

check inspirations -> check faostat


1-group and cluster data by topic and link between each indicator
2-how to present the data



whats on the main page

main topic -> filter by country -> filter by indicator
Or
map -> catalogue of the chosen country


---> great amount of data -> how to retreive insightful infos from it -> static dashboards/ entry points (classes of datas or maps with countries)
big story with multiple chapters -> how to link between these components

>Questions
are we planning to not use all the data?


>National data:


>International Data:
