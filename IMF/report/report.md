there's climate datasets, stuff bout :
    Forest and Carbon/
    Annual estimates of land cover and Climate Altering Land Cove
    surface temperature change
    gas emission


ELSE a lot of economics / financial datasets
    eg : international financial statistics

The term "time series" refers to a sequence of data points measured at specific time intervals. In the context of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) DataMapper API, a "time series that are used in the DataMapper" refers to specific sets of economic or financial data that are included in the DataMapper platform.

The IMF DataMapper is an online tool provided by the IMF that allows users to access and visualize various economic and financial indicators over time



DIFF BETWEEN THE TWO APIS

The IMF DataMapper API only provides information about the time series that are used in the DataMapper, while the IMF Data Portal API provides access to all IMF datasets.
The IMF DataMapper API has endpoints for getting lists of indicators, countries, regions, and analytical groups used in time series, while the IMF Data Portal API has endpoints for getting metadata, data, and documentation for all IMF datasets.
The IMF DataMapper API only covers time series that are used in the DataMapper, while the IMF Data Portal API covers all IMF datasets.



--->>>> In other words, the IMF DataMapper API is a more specialized API that is designed for users who want to visualize IMF data using the DataMapper tool. The IMF Data Portal API is a more comprehensive API that is designed for users who want to access all IMF datasets, including metadata, data, and documentation.

Indicators needed found in IMF DataMapper API, further inspection is needed on the Data Portal API (If some indicator is missing from worldbank)

Merging/ ('arbitrage') between IMF and WorldBank is still   to be done
