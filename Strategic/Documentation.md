Sales file should be changed after insertion to work only on updating the last one


File codes for now

'blendingPlants',
'CRU_FERTILIZER_WEEK',
'FertlizerWeekPremium',
'potentialConsumption',
'sales'


idea for cron : put file that'll be automatically known, then added to the db each day at 00:00 then deletes the xlsx
